# cicdash
A dashboard for viewing Continuous Integration / Continuous Development job builds and pipelines

It's 10 am on Monday. Do you know if any of your job builds are failing? Keeping track of even a few job pipelines can quickly overwhelm your inbox. You want to do creative work, but first you need to know: "do I need to fix anything?"
If only there were a dashboard where you could see on one page the most recent builds for all your pipeline jobs.

Enter CICDash:  A dashboard microservice you can run on localhost or server of your choice.
